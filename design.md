## CAD & Graphic Design
* ### Utiliduct Pipe Support Detail
    As a mechanical contractor I designed a pipe support [rack](photos\pipe_support.jpg) based on project design specifications, mechanical engineering principles and manufacturer datasheets. These racks were designed under extremely tight tolerances for installation in an existing utility duct. The drawings was used to verify dimensions and appropriately size and specify hardware components. Approved by the design engineering firm and built per these drawings. (Created with DraftSight)
* ### End-Suction Circulating Pump Piping
    A 2-dimensional [drawing](photos\pump_piping.jpg) used to determine necessary specifications for weld fittings and pump flex connectors before ordering materials. (Created with DraftSight)
* ### Lowell Digisonde Site Survey for Poker Flat Research Range
    Used satellite imagery and GIS data to develop a graphical site [plan](photos\ionosonde.jpg) for the installation of an atmospheric scientific instrument called an ionosonde. Incorporated dimensional from Lowell Digisonde installation manual, geographic and mangnetic North, and information from site walk such as pre-existing structures and power lines.
* ### RF Station Block Diagrams
    Designed RF transmitter and receiving stations for an R&D project and created a block [diagram](photos\diagram.jpg) used in planning and technical documentation.
* ### Brochure For Mechanical Contractor
    Designed a double-sided tri-fold [brochure](photos\cmi_brochure.pdf) for Central Mechanical with original copy and photography.
