## Radio & Electronics Projects
* ### Ghosts In The Airglow - by Amanda Dawn Christie
    Technical consultation, SDR receiver operation, audio/video decoding
    via AM/SSB/SSTV and produced real-time livestream event. Check out Amanda's [site](https://www.ghostsintheairglow.space/#home-section) for information and archived [video](https://www.ghostsintheairglow.space/live-feed). Supported by Canada Council for the Arts.
* ### Amateur Radio Science Experiment at HAARP
    Designed an experiment to test a hypothesis of the phenomenon of Ionospheric Cross-Modulation (Luxembourg Effect). This was the first ever [crowdfunded](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/amateur-radio-science-experiment-at-haarp#/) science experiment at HAARP.
* ### Prototyping and PCB design of a circular polarized HF receiving antenna.
    A collaboration with Eric Nichols, KL7AJ - [design](photos\exogon_cad.jpg) and [prototype](photos\exogon_prototype.jpg) resulting in a [PCB](photos\exogon_pcb.jpg) kit for Amateur Radio enthusiasts.  You can find a copy of his book ["Receiving Antennas for the Radio Amateur"](https://www.amazon.com/Receiving-Antennas-Radio-Amateur-Nichols/dp/1625950780) where the eXogon antenna is featured.
* ### GNU Radio Flowgraph with DigitalRF (HDF5) Implementation
    Built a simple FM receiver flowgraph that records I/Q data to HDF5 format with the DigitalRF library. SDR is an Ettus N200.
