## Jeff's Portfolio

I like making things and finding solutions.

### Introduction

I am creative, collaborative and a problem solver. With over 20 years
of diverse experience. I can relate well to people and deliver results
that make a big impact. I know how to bridge the gap between the
theoretical and practical.

Because I have many different skills, sometimes it's too much to put
on a resume. I made this portfolio to showcase some of my work. Just
scroll down the page and see what things I could possibly help you
with.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jdak907/portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
