## _I like finding solutions and making things._

I am creative, collaborative and a problem solver. With over 20 years
of diverse experience. I can relate well to people and deliver results
that make a big impact. I know how to bridge the gap between the
theoretical and practical. Because I have many different skills, it's too much to put on a resume. I made this portfolio to showcase some of my work. Just scroll down and see what things I can do for you or your organization.
