## _I like finding solutions and making things._

I am creative, collaborative and a problem solver. With over 20 years
of diverse experience. I can relate well to people and deliver results
that make a big impact. I know how to bridge the gap between the
theoretical and practical. Because I have many different skills, sometimes it's too much to put on a resume. I made this portfolio to showcase some of my work. Just scroll down the page and see what things I could possibly help you
with.
