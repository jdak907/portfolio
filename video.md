* ### Building Demolition
    Produced a time-lapse video of a building demolition. This was shot on a GoPro camera with an improvised power supply fed by a portable inverter generator. The constant charging of the battery kept the camera warm in the -20Â°F weather and enabled me to shoot the entire process without having to change the battery. (GoPro Studio)
